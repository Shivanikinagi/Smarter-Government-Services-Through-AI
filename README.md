📊 Smarter Government Services Through AI
📑 Overview
Smarter Government Services Through AI is an AI-driven initiative designed to enhance public service delivery, improve operational efficiency, and foster citizen-centric governance through advanced data analytics, natural language processing (NLP), and machine learning. This project aims to streamline government workflows, predict public service demands, detect anomalies, and provide actionable insights for policymakers.

🎯 Problem Statement
Modern government services often face challenges like:

Slow response times

Inefficient resource allocation

Difficulty in handling large volumes of citizen feedback

Lack of data-driven decision-making

This project addresses these challenges by integrating AI solutions to make government services smarter, faster, and more transparent.
